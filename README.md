# capstone-project

 Used the following technologies:
Spring Boot, 
Spring MVC,
Thymeleaf,
Spring Security,
Spring Data JPA,
Hibernate/JPA,
MySQL database.
I have written an java spring app that serves as a job portal.  It has two types of users, Recruiter and Job Seeker.
Recruiters can create new jobs and Job Candidates can search for new jobs and apply.
